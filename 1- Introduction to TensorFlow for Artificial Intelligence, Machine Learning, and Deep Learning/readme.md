# Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

# Intro

This course consider as a brief introduction to the world of Neural Networks we will learn to creat basic NN with 1 hidden layer, Then we will introduced to computer vision
and how to work with different images.

# Syllabus:
  - **Week 1 - A New Programming Paradigm**
    - A NN Hello World problem where we try to solve linear equation with single layer NN
  - **Week 2- Introduction to Computer Vision**
    - MultiClass problem with Fashion MNIST Data
  -  **Week 3 - Enhancing Vision with Convolutional Neural Networks**
     - First introduction to convolution layer and enhancing our model
  -  **Week 4 - Using Real-world Images**
     - Working with larger and more complix images
